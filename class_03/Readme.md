# Component :
 
  Components are reusable building blocks of your application, similar to React components.

  They allow you to create modular, maintainable, and scalable user interfaces. Here's a breakdown of components in Next.js

## Props :
    
    Props are a fundamental part of how components communicate and share data in Next.js (and React)

## Linking : 

1. First, make sure you have the pages you want to link to for Example:  1.page.tsx  2.about.tsx

2. In the file where you want to create the link (like in a navigation bar), import the Link component from next/link.

3.  Wrap your text or button in the Link component and set the href attribute to the path of the page you want to link to.

4.    <Link href="/">Home</Link>
      <Link href="/about">About</Link>

  5.Add your links to your layout or components.


  ## Routing :
     
     Routing is the process of navigating between different pages or components in your application. 

   Next.js uses a file-based routing system, which makes it easy to create and manage routes.


## Navigation:

    Navigation refers to the way users move between different pages or sections of a website or application.
